# Project name: svelte-konva

> Please refer to **package.json** for relevant information such as _version, deps, etc._

### Motivation

> Konva.js is Canvas API framework, which already has wrappers for React, Vue, but there is no (proper?) Svelte wrapper for Konva.js . This is it â€“ it's time for Svelte for Konva to manifast : just like React, Vue, we can (AND) will take advantage of Svelte for its simplicity, built-in state management with svelte/store, etc.; 

> Please keep in mind, I am starting the project as solo initially, but may accept any PR request in the future .

Cheers !
