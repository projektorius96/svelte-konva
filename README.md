# Project name: svelte-konva

> Please refer to `<root>/package.json` for relevant information such as _version, deps, etc._

### Motivation

> Konva.js is Canvas API framework, which already has wrappers for React, Vue, but there is no (_proper?_) Svelte wrapper for Konva.js _at least at the time of publishing this README.md_ . This is it â€“ it's time Svelte for Konva to manifest : just like React, Vue, we can (AND) will take advantage of Svelte for its simplicity, built-in state management with svelte/store, etc.; 

> Please keep in mind, I am starting the project as solo initially, but may accept any PR request in the future .

### A manual linking recipe :

> **DEV_NOTE** # Please refer to [svelte-konva/tree/npm-link](https://github.com/projektorius96/svelte-konva/tree/npm-link) as this is `develop`_-only_ codebase branch that does not contain procedures as well as no files for manual linkage
